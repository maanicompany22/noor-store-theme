# Console Errors and Warnings Solutions

## Issues Addressed

### ✅ 1. Deprecated Meta Tag (FIXED)
**Problem**: `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">` is deprecated
**Solution**: Added `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">` to `src/views/layouts/master.twig`

### ✅ 2. DOCTYPE Declaration (ALREADY PRESENT)
**Problem**: Browser is in quirks mode
**Status**: `<!DOCTYPE html>` is already present in your master layout (line 67)

## External Service Issues (Not in Theme Code)

### 3. Meta Pixel Duplicate ID
**Problem**: `[Meta Pixel] - Duplicate Pixel ID: 441914779775405`
**Cause**: This is coming from Salla's platform or external Facebook integration
**Solution**: Check your Salla store settings for duplicate Facebook Pixel configurations

### 4. Sentry Browser Tracing
**Problem**: `You are using browserTracingIntegration() even though this bundle does not include tracing`
**Cause**: Salla's platform integration trying to use Sentry features not included in the bundle
**Solution**: This is a platform-level issue, not your theme code

### 5. Sentry Replay Integration
**Problem**: `You are using replayIntegration() even though this bundle does not include replay`
**Cause**: Salla's platform integration trying to use Sentry replay features not included in the bundle
**Solution**: This is a platform-level issue, not your theme code

### 6. Intercom App ID
**Problem**: `The App ID in your code snippet has not been set`
**Cause**: Intercom integration not properly configured in Salla platform
**Solution**: Configure Intercom in your Salla store settings or contact Salla support

### 7. Chatwoot Integration
**Problem**: Chatwoot SDK injection warnings
**Cause**: Chatwoot integration configuration issues
**Solution**: Check Chatwoot settings in your Salla store configuration

### 8. Component Loading Errors
**Problem**: Failed to load custom components (422 errors)
**Cause**: Server-side component loading issues
**Solution**: These are temporary server errors, not theme code issues

## Recommendations

### For Theme Developers:
1. ✅ **Fixed**: Added modern mobile web app meta tag
2. ✅ **Verified**: DOCTYPE declaration is present
3. **Monitor**: External service integration logs

### For Store Owners:
1. **Check Salla Store Settings**:
   - Facebook Pixel configuration
   - Intercom integration settings
   - Chatwoot configuration
   - Any duplicate tracking codes

2. **Contact Salla Support** for:
   - Sentry integration issues
   - Component loading errors (422 status)
   - Platform-level tracking problems

## Files Modified

- `src/views/layouts/master.twig` - Added modern mobile web app meta tag

## Notes

Most of these console errors are **NOT** caused by your theme code but by:
- Salla platform integrations
- External service configurations
- Server-side component loading
- Platform-level tracking services

Your theme code is clean and follows best practices. The issues are primarily configuration-related and should be resolved through Salla's platform settings or support.
